# About this repository

Members' in AliveX's innovation solution research team need to conduct a lot of POC experiments with a combination of
extensive techniques such as backend development, frontend development, Data Science, AI, bioinformatics, data
visualization, human-computer interaction etc. As a result, our members need to be familiar with several programming
languages and a lot of packages.

It's very challenging to learn all those staff and keep them fresh in mind!

So we create this repository to provide a series of tutorials and demo codes planning to cover a board range of topics.
We wish they can help our new members and others on github to have a smoother learning curve, and pick up things more
easily when picking some tools after several months not using it.

It's ambitious project which is not possible to accomplish by only several members, so welcome to make contributions to
this project:)

# Topics

## Programming Languages

Tutorials and demos Mainly focus on Python, Typescript and C/C++. The possible, comparison for the same feather will be
provided. For example, how Python, Typescript and C/C++ can iterate each object in a container object.

## Application Tasks

Tutorials and demos about how to accomplish application tasks with the help of programming languages and packages
